All are multicultural as well as the financial hubs of their respective countries. We want to explore how much they are similar or dissimilar in aspects from a tourist point of view regarding food, accommodation, beautiful places, and many more.\nTourism industry is important for the benefits it brings and due to its role as a commercial activity that creates demand and growth for many more industries. Tourism not only contributes towards more economic activities but also generates more employment, revenues and play a significant role in development. Many countries such as Turkey, France and Italy depend heavily on tourism industry for their expanses. \n"

Therefore, for anyone who relies on tourists and tourism, understanding the consumer behavior is essential. In this project I will focus on venues such as restaurants, hotels, parks, cafes, cinemas and so on in London, Toronto and New York and cluster their neighborhoods in order to understand the similarities and differences between these cities. Therefor the target audience would be tourists and travel agencies. Tourists can explore neighborhoods in each city and decide which city they prefer to visit or if they have been to one of these cities before and enjoyed their visit, they can select a similar city to travel next time. Travel agencies also can recommend destinations to their customers based on customers\u2019 experience and similarity and dissimilarity between different cities."

To explore, analyze and segment neighborhoods, longitude and latitude of each neighborhood and borough will be added.\nThis dataset exists for free on the web. I used this website: https://skgrange.github.io/www/data/london_sport.json\n\n### 2.1.2 New York:\nNew York has a total of 5 boroughs and 306 neighborhoods. In order to segment the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\nLuckily, this dataset exists for free on the web. Here is the link to the dataset: https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572\n\n### 2.1.3 Toronto:\nFor Toronto I used the table in Wikipedia for postal code and borough of each neighborhood. (link to the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M ) and for the longitude and latitude of each neighborhood I used a csv file available in: : http://cocl.us/Geospatial_data\n\n## 2.2 Foursquare API\nin order to explore neighborhoods and cluster them we need to search for venues in each neighborhood. Foursquare API(utilized via the Request library in Python) permits to provide venues information for each neighborhood.\n\n\n"
